Project Description:
https://github.com/SCCapstone/TheB-Team/wiki/Project-Description

// Your audience for the Readme.md are other developers who are joining your team.
// Specifically, the file should contain detailed instructions that any developer
// can follow to install, compile, run, and test your project. These are not only
// useful to new developers, but also to you when you have to re-install everything
// because your old laptop crashed. Also, the teachers of this class will be
// following your instructions.

## External Requirements

// List all the stuff the reader will need to install in order to get you app to 
// run in their laptop. For example:

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwiNSLBhCPARIsAKNS4_fHPfZJChPiHD5t2YEJbsPt7FmqcqDpQycnGLTCVL7LORnNfL3FuGgaArLTEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
* [VisualStuidoCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

// If possible, list the actual commands you used to install these, so the reader
// can just cut-n-paste the commands and get everything setup.

// You only need to add instructions for the OS you are using.

## Setup

// Here you list all the one-time things the developer needs to do after cloning
// your repo. Sometimes there is no need for this section, but some apps require
// some first-time configuration from the developer, for example: setting up a
// database for running your webapp locally.

npm install

## Running

// Specify the commands for a developer to run the app from the cloned repo.

npm run serve
<copy localhost url to browser>

# Deployment

// Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
// Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
// . Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

# Testing

// In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
// section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/selenium/`.

## Testing Technology

// In some cases you need to install test runners, etc. Explain how.

For the behavioral tests, go to 'https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/' and download the 'Selenium IDE' extension to Chrome. 

## Running Tests

// Explain how to run the automated tests.
  
For the behavioral tests, open the Selenium IDE extension from Chrome and click 'Open an existing project.' Select the behavioral test you would like to run and, finally, click the 'run all tests' button.
